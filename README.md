==================

A simple gedcom parser for ruby

Background
==========

This gedcom parser was one of my very first ruby projects developed around 2007. While not my best code, I leave it up here as a nostalgic reminder of how my skills have developed over time. It's also a fairly decent GEDCOM parser which is pretty rare and could give others ideas for building a better one if needed.
